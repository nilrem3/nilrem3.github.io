upgrade: boost juice multiplier boost feather gain
layer: duck nests, based on duck feathers, layer effect gives duck eggs per second, duck eggs are spend on upgrades

layer where each row has 3 upgrades and you can only pick one

duck buyable that makes duck buyables cheaper

challenges where u gain some kind of points while in it but u can never actually complete it

fuck i had a good idea for what the p4 layer bonus should be but i forgot
probably it was feather gain or smth
